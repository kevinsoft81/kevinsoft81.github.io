In researching Cisco, you discovered that they are holding a large amount of cash. Additionally, your client is upset that the Cisco stock price has been somewhat stagnant as of late. The client is considering approaching the Board of Directors with a plan for half of the cash the firm has accumulated, but can’t decide whether a share repurchase or a special dividend would be best. You have been asked to determine which initiative would generate the greatest amount of money after taxes, assuming that with a share repurchase your client would keep the same proportion of ownership. Because both dividends and capital gains are taxed at the same rate (20%), your client has assumed that there is no difference between the repurchase and the dividend.

scenario.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"d0c94e3a-1214-43de-aed9-fc9373896a2a"}]}]},{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"ordered-list","data":{"listOptionType":"1","startValue":1},"ref":"311efe3e-9644-40a0-b7de-be2697d9b338","nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"list-item","data":{"direction":"auto"},"ref":"004d823d-8d03-465c-ab81-13820eee68dc","nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"c88371ac-2a03-41c7-9884-ee611d8092fe","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Go
