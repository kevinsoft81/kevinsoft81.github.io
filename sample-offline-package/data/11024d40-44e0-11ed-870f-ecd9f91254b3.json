The problem with this argument is that it ignores the fact that investors can achieve the benefits of diversification themselves by purchasing shares in the two separate firms. Because most stockholders will already be holding a well-diversified portfolio, they get no further benefit from the firm diversifying through acquisition. Moreover, as we have already pointed out, there are costs associated with merging and with running a large diversified firm. Because it may be harder to measure performance accurately in a conglomerate, agency costs may increase and resources may be inefficiently allocated across divisions. As a result, it is cheaper for investors to diversify their own portfolios than to have the corporation do it through acquisition.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"c27f366d-f199-4003-919a-08ad2b43ccdc"}]}]},{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"heading-three","ref":"9fe2bdbf-204a-4a3a-97b1-536e969a3db1","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Debt Capacity and Borrowing Costs","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"6766aecb-48fa-4d77-9dc3-d2074c33d66f"}]}]},{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"8380587d-e0e8-4b3a-b574-efe62f50992b","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"All else being equal, larger more diversified firms have a lower probability of bankruptcy given the same degree of leverage.
