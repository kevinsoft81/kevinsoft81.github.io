Interest rates are clearly central to the functioning of any financial system. To understand interest rates, it’s important to think of interest rates as a price—the price of using money. When you borrow money to buy a car, you are using the bank’s money now to get the car and paying the money back over time. The interest rate on your loan is the price you pay to be able to convert your future loan payments into a car today. Similarly, when you deposit money into a savings account, you are letting the bank use your money until you withdraw it later. The interest the bank pays you on your deposit is the price it pays to use your money (for things like making car loans).","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"091761d8-5654-4b53-b6d6-98e80de941f9"}]}]},{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"d32f5ac5-8baf-48b4-98cd-faaf839c8d71","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Just like any other price, interest rates are set by market forces, in particular the supply of and demand for funds.

In practice, interest is paid, and interest rates are quoted, in different ways. For example, in early 2019, PNC Bank offered savings accounts with a rate of 2.35% annually with interest paid on a daily basis, while other banks offered savings rates with interest paid on a quarterly or annual basis. Interest rates can also differ depending on the investment horizon. In January 2018, investors earned around 1.8% on one-year risk-free U.S. Treasury Bills, but could earn around 2.8% on 20-year Treasuries. Interest rates can also vary due to risk or tax consequences: The U.S. government is able to borrow at a lower interest rate than Johnson & Johnson, which in turn can borrow at a lower rate than American Airlines.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"3c4759ff-dfe1-4888-9b0c-b217ce4cc703"}]}]},{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"af8b73d2-cbee-4431-a7d9-65ef7a8638dc","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Because interest rates may be quoted for different time intervals, such as monthly, semiannually, or annually, it is often necessary to adjust the interest rate to a time period that matches that of our cash flows.
