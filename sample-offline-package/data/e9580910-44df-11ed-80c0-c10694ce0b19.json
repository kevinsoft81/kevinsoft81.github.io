These venues compete with one another for order volume. Because traders value liquid markets, an important area of competition is liquidityâ€”exchanges try to ensure that their limit order books are deep, that is, contain many orders. As a result exchanges have been experimenting with different rules designed to encourage traders who provide liquidity and discourage traders who take advantage of stale limit orders. For example, some trading venues pay traders to post limit orders and charge traders who place market orders. Others pay for volume from retail investors, and impose additional charges on high frequency trading. The proliferation of exchange venues has generated a wide variety of different compensation schemes. Indeed, BATS (which stands for Better Alternative Trading System) operates different markets with different rules, essentially tailoring their markets to the perceived needs of their customers. It is highly unlikely that we have seen the end of these changes. Stock markets remain in a state of flux, and only time will tell what the eventual shakeout will look like.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"4fb76c26-5297-47b3-bf04-faf7550ad8ef"}]}]}]}]},"screenType":"","transitions":{"enter":{"animation":"","duration":0,"easing":"","customKeyframes":""},"exit":{"animation":"","duration":0,"easing":"","customKeyframes":""}},"lockElements":false,"learnerCurrentAttempt":1,"footer":{"buttonText":"Next","buttonIcon":"Arrow","showFooter":false,"showHistoryNavButtons":false,"previewFooter":false,"position":"Fixed to screen bottom","footerComponent":{"showFooterDropArea":"hide","width":100,"footerComponentsAlignment":"right"}},"styles":{"background":{},"stage":{"maxWidth":940,"background":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","responsive":true,"padding":{"vertical":60,"horizontal":60},"border":{"color":"rgba(224, 224, 224, 1)","radius":0,"width":0}},"elements":{"padding":{"vertical":10,"horizontal":10}},"footer":{"buttonColor":"rgba(0, 115, 202, 1)","textColor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)","backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","padding":10,"corners":4,"border":"none","shadow":"0 -1px 4px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 0 12px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"},"feedback":{"width":320,"textColor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)","backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","corners":4,"border":"none","shadow":"0 5px 47px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 10px 20px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 7px 8px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"}},"title":"Dark Pools"},"assets":[],"scenarios":[],"pluginPayload":{"pluginRepositoryPath":"https://plugin-repository-bronte-qaint.pearson.com/9417ac60-5f60-11ea-8e69-affb2224d7e8/0.15.209/ac43ee4c0eda05e9718fa83a5aed4cff.zip","summary":{"pluginId":"9417ac60-5f60-11ea-8e69-affb2224d7e8","name":"Screen","description":"A screen of a lesson","type":"screen","latestVersion":"0.15.209","subscriptionId":"f0afd4d0-d2ff-11ea-9998-d57e1e28aca1","createdAt":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 04:11:39 GMT","updatedAt":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 22:07:46 GMT","tags":[],"publishMode":"DEFAULT"}},"activityThemeIconLibraries":[]}
