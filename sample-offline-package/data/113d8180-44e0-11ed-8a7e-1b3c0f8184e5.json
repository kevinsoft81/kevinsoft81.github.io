There are a number of reasons. The board might legitimately believe that the offer price is too low. In this case, a suitor that is willing to pay more might be found or the original bidder might be convinced to raise its offer. Alternatively, if the offer is a stock-swap, target management may oppose the offer because they feel the acquirer’s shares are overvalued, and therefore that the value of the offer is actually less than the stand-alone value of the target. Finally, managers (and the board) might oppose a takeover because of their own self-interests, especially if the primary motivation for the takeover is efficiency gains. In this case, the acquirer most likely plans to undertake a complete change of leadership of the corporation. Upper-level managers could view opposing the merger as a way of protecting their jobs (and the jobs of their employees). In fact, this concern is perhaps the single biggest reason for the negative associations that hostile takeovers generate. Bear in mind that if substantial efficiency gains are indeed possible, current management is not doing an effective job. A takeover, or threat thereof, might be the only recourse investors have to fix the problem.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"78aca8a9-44b4-4ad7-a075-781c69eaa9db"},{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"55fea413-f159-4613-b67b-191c39b4fea6","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"In theory, the duty of the target board of directors is to choose the course of action that is in the best interests of the target shareholders.
