The stockholders have invested in the corporation, putting their money at risk to become the owners of the corporation. Thus, the financial manager is a caretaker of the stockholders’ money, making decisions in their interests. Many corporations have thousands of owners (shareholders). These shareholders vary from large institutions to small first-time investors, from retirees living off their investments to young employees just starting to save for retirement. Each owner is likely to have different interests and priorities. Whose interests and priorities determine the goals of the firm? You might be surprised to learn that the interests of shareholders are aligned for many, if not most, important decisions. Regardless of their own personal financial position and stage in life, all the shareholders will agree that they are better off if the value of their investment in the corporation is maximized. For example, suppose the decision concerns whether to develop a new product that will be a profitable investment for the corporation. All shareholders will very likely agree that developing this product is a good idea. Returning to our iPhone example, by October 2010, Apple shares were worth three times as much as they were in January 2007, when the first iPhone was introduced. All Apple shareholders at the time of the development of the first iPhone are clearly much better off because of it, whether they have since sold their shares of Apple to pay for retirement, or are still holding those shares in their retirement savings account.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"96b6d543-ee92-4aa2-8ba1-01f81b7674ac"},{"type":"stage-element-image","config":{"url":{"$ambrosia":"aero:asset:upload","urn":"urn:aero:706d7ca0-44e0-11ed-928f-6f45b86fb3a4","asset":{"urn":"urn:aero:706d7ca0-44e0-11ed-928f-6f45b86fb3a4","asset":{"assetProvider":"ALFRESCO","id":"706d7ca0-44e0-11ed-928f-6f45b86fb3a4","assetMediaType":"image","assetVisibility":"GLOBAL","ownerId":"e88133a0-8dc4-11eb-964e-4d7e264c9958","subscriptionId":"f0afd4d0-d2ff-11ea-9998-d57e1e28aca1","alfrescoId":"e639144f-cd06-4cde-8253-b3baa143963b","name":"PH_01_001.jpg","version":"2.0","lastModifiedDate":1664998750,"lastSyncDate":1665085914},"source":{"small":{"width":380,"url":"https://assets-bronte-qaint.pearson.com/706d7ca0-44e0-11ed-928f-6f45b86fb3a4/small/110db18798b27fe58db37c200f105af0.jpeg","height":300},"original":{"width":380,"url":"https://assets-bronte-qaint.pearson.com/706d7ca0-44e0-11ed-928f-6f45b86fb3a4/small/110db18798b27fe58db37c200f105af0.jpeg","height":300},"thumb":{"width":190,"url":"https://assets-bronte-qaint.pearson.com/706d7ca0-44e0-11ed-928f-6f45b86fb3a4/thumb/110db18798b27fe58db37c200f105af0.jpeg","height":150}},"metadata":{"altText":"","workURN":"","caption":"","alfrescoPath":"bronte-e2e-testing-qaint/documentLibrary/BV E2E Test/[10-05-2022] Berk","originalAssetName":"PH_01_001.jpg","longDesc":"","height":"392"}}},"alt":"","caption":"","layout":{"captionPosition":"Below"},"credit":"","activityLabel":"","activityTitle":""},"height":392,"ref":"70d0fa5f-2774-4e67-8fa6-fb6ef7d29288"},{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"37e9ac3b-c0d9-494a-be51-2b32b3986948","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Even when all the owners of a corporation agree on the goals of the corporation, these goals must be implemented.
