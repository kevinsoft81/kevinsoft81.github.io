Each merger wave was characterized by a typical type of deal. The increase in activity in the 1960s is known as the “conglomerate wave” because firms typically acquired firms in unrelated businesses. At the time, it was thought that managerial expertise was portable across business lines and that the conglomerate business form offered great financial advantages. This conglomerate fad eventually fell out of favor, and the 1980s were known for hostile, “bust-up” takeovers, in which the acquirer purchased a poorly performing conglomerate and sold off its individual business units for more than the purchase price. The 1990s, in contrast, were known for “strategic” or “global” deals that were more likely to be friendly and to involve companies in related businesses; these mergers often were designed to create strong firms on a scale that would allow them to compete globally. At the end of 2004, takeover activity began to pick up again, starting the next big merger wave, marked by consolidation in many industries such as telecommunications and software. This wave also saw private equity playing a larger role than it had in the past, with some private equity groups such as KKR, TPG, Blackrock, and Cerberus taking private ever-larger firms such as Hertz (see ","marks":[]},{"object":"inline","type":"reference-link","ref":"e45a1d10-b545-4e5f-85b9-200e66e04a74","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Chapter 15","marks":[]}],"data":{"reference":"52d11d40-44e1-11ed-8442-dbcbc27803ca"}},{"object":"text","text":"), Chrysler, and Harrah’s.
