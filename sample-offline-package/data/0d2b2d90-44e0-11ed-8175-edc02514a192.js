This exercise has two distinct objectives. First, a company forecasts its cash flows to determine whether it will have surplus cash or a cash deficit for each period. Second, management needs to decide whether that surplus or deficit is temporary or permanent. If it is permanent, it may affect the firm’s long-term financial decisions. For example, if a company anticipates an ongoing surplus of cash, it may choose to increase its dividend payout. Deficits resulting from investments in long-term projects are often financed using long-term sources of capital, such as equity or long-term bonds.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"26d77338-1eed-42d1-a524-a6c205ae74e2"}]}]},{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"9f82f9f3-5570-45ae-844c-f6eaf0e40486","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"In this chapter, we focus specifically on short-term financial planning.
