This technique requires exceptional coordination with suppliers as well as a predictable demand for the firm’s products. In 2007, Boeing established a global production system for its new 787 “Dreamliner.” Very little of the plane is actually produced at its plant in Everett, Washington. Rather, all of its major systems, including the fuselage and wings, are produced elsewhere and are flown to the final assembly plant using a specially modified 747 cargo plane. The pieces arrive very shortly before they are needed in the final assembly of the airplane, so Boeing does not have to face the carrying costs of maintaining a large inventory. However, such a plan has risks, as Boeing initially had substantial troubles with its contracted producers finishing their parts on time. Consequently, it delayed the delivery of the first planes and suffered financial penalties from doing so. By 2010, with the 787 in flight-testing, Boeing remained committed to the new production system, although it had to send thousands of its own engineers out to suppliers to help solve bottleneck problems. In some cases, it even bought its suppliers.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"3a9b952f-6b74-417a-8320-864567c5c093"}]}]}]},{"cssClass":"aside-group  Sidebar_1Aside","rows":[{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"heading-two","ref":"d14c6c57-cf2a-4ae3-92e3-edf8428ee6ba","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Inventory Management Adds to the Bottom Line at Gap","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"4dd1d97c-2af0-4f9a-b01c-a0198c931197"},{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"14ea1a29-0d5a-4dcd-a48b-b032fbc0404a","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"In 2003, the apparel chain GAP reduced its investment in inventory significantly by reducing its inventory days outstanding by 24%.
