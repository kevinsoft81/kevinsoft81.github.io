To mitigate these incentives, the TCJA introduced several new tax provisions known by their acronyms: GILTI, FDII, and BEAT. Policymakers created these provisions to combat two potential concerns. The first is the possibility that when firms produce output for the foreign markets, they might lower their tax burden by shifting the portion of profits associated with intangible assets (such as patents or brand names) into foreign subsidiaries, rather than locating them in the United States. GILTI and FDII were introduced to mitigate this incentive. The second concern is the possibility that firms might use their foreign subsidiary to produce output for the U.S. market. To place limits on this behavior, BEAT was introduced. A full discussion of GILTI, FDII, and BEAT is beyond the scope of this book, but the general takeaway is the the tax reform attempted to eliminate incentives to shift and retain profits and valuable assets outside the US.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"1982ce88-2904-4ce1-863b-e96205972d3c"}]}]}]},{"cssClass":"aside-group Sidebar_1Aside","rows":[{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"heading-two","ref":"297f2398-171c-4cdf-87f9-6adb95cb3b30","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Concept Check","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"68886098-fcd6-43dd-b1e0-9300ab613939"},{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"ordered-list","data":{"listOptionType":"1","startValue":9},"ref":"ebabb698-b0ee-4bb2-9e99-731aa66b98a5","nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"list-item","data":{"direction":"auto"},"ref":"3288c9d6-d754-4824-a69b-0b82c2be2f59","nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"97e1ad18-2d48-4eea-a037-a5c6c9b93ee9","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"How did the 2017 TCJA change U.S. firmsâ€™ incentive to repatriate foreign profits?","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]},{"object":"block","type":"list-item","data":{"direction":"auto"},"ref":"69d87771-fa8e-439a-a16a-94a55bc9d68f","nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"8205dd86-3dbe-4202-8fe3-288ed7f09086","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"What were two potential concerns with the new system under TCJA?","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}]}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"3172ee39-6101-461c-bb84-ad96da611122"}]}]}]}]},"screenType":"","transitions":{"enter":{"animation":"","duration":0,"easing":"","customKeyframes":""},"exit":{"animation":"","duration":0,"easing":"","customKeyframes":""}},"lockElements":false,"learnerCurrentAttempt":1,"footer":{"buttonText":"Next","buttonIcon":"Arrow","showFooter":false,"showHistoryNavButtons":false,"previewFooter":false,"position":"Fixed to screen bottom","footerComponent":{"showFooterDropArea":"hide","width":100,"footerComponentsAlignment":"right"}},"styles":{"background":{},"stage":{"maxWidth":940,"background":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","responsive":true,"padding":{"vertical":60,"horizontal":60},"border":{"color":"rgba(224, 224, 224, 1)","radius":0,"width":0}},"elements":{"padding":{"vertical":10,"horizontal":10}},"footer":{"buttonColor":"rgba(0, 115, 202, 1)","textColor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)","backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","padding":10,"corners":4,"border":"none","shadow":"0 -1px 4px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 0 12px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"},"feedback":{"width":320,"textColor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)","backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","corners":4,"border":"none","shadow":"0 5px 47px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 10px 20px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 7px 8px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"}},"title":"The TCJA: A New Approach to International Taxation"},"assets":[],"scenarios":[],"pluginPayload":{"pluginRepositoryPath":"https://plugin-repository-bronte-qaint.pearson.com/9417ac60-5f60-11ea-8e69-affb2224d7e8/0.15.209/ac43ee4c0eda05e9718fa83a5aed4cff.zip","summary":{"pluginId":"9417ac60-5f60-11ea-8e69-affb2224d7e8","name":"Screen","description":"A screen of a lesson","type":"screen","latestVersion":"0.15.209","subscriptionId":"f0afd4d0-d2ff-11ea-9998-d57e1e28aca1","createdAt":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 04:11:39 GMT","updatedAt":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 22:07:46 GMT","tags":[],"publishMode":"DEFAULT"}},"activityThemeIconLibraries":[]}
