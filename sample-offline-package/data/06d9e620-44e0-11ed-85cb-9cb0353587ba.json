As the figure makes clear, the dollar volume of IPOs grew significantly in the early 1990s, reaching a peak in 1999–2000. An even more important feature of the data is that the trends related to the number of issues are cyclical. Sometimes, as in 1996, the volume of IPOs is unprecedented by historical standards, yet within a year or two the volume of IPOs may decrease significantly. This cyclicality by itself is not particularly surprising. We would expect there to be a greater need for capital in times with more growth opportunities than in times with fewer growth opportunities. What is surprising is the magnitude of the swings. For example, it is difficult to explain the almost seven-fold increase in IPOs from the early to mid-1990s, and the nearly 75% drop from 2000 to 2001, a 45% drop from 2014 to 2015, and an increase of 20% from 2017 to 2018. It appears that the number of IPOs is not solely driven by the demand for capital. Sometimes firms and investors seem to favor IPOs; at other times firms appear to rely on alternative sources of capital.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"481923bb-928e-46bd-b887-14745c08a47f"},{"type":"stage-element-image","config":{"url":{"$ambrosia":"aero:asset:upload","urn":"urn:aero:c32f8d70-44e0-11ed-9967-59bbd5f34c83","asset":{"urn":"urn:aero:c32f8d70-44e0-11ed-9967-59bbd5f34c83","asset":{"assetProvider":"ALFRESCO","id":"c32f8d70-44e0-11ed-9967-59bbd5f34c83","assetMediaType":"image","assetVisibility":"GLOBAL","ownerId":"e88133a0-8dc4-11eb-964e-4d7e264c9958","subscriptionId":"f0afd4d0-d2ff-11ea-9998-d57e1e28aca1","alfrescoId":"7709ebab-4ebd-46de-a400-62064955b078","name":"FG_14_006.jpg","version":"2.0","lastModifiedDate":1664998398,"lastSyncDate":1665085923},"source":{"small":{"width":534,"url":"https://assets-bronte-qaint.pearson.com/c32f8d70-44e0-11ed-9967-59bbd5f34c83/small/c9f9a8803402ced8ca96ea36c3c8bb9a.jpeg","height":300},"original":{"width":1068,"url":"https://assets-bronte-qaint.pearson.com/c32f8d70-44e0-11ed-9967-59bbd5f34c83/medium/c9f9a8803402ced8ca96ea36c3c8bb9a.jpeg","height":600},"medium":{"width":1068,"url":"https://assets-bronte-qaint.pearson.com/c32f8d70-44e0-11ed-9967-59bbd5f34c83/medium/c9f9a8803402ced8ca96ea36c3c8bb9a.jpeg","height":600},"thumb":{"width":267,"url":"https://assets-bronte-qaint.pearson.com/c32f8d70-44e0-11ed-9967-59bbd5f34c83/thumb/c9f9a8803402ced8ca96ea36c3c8bb9a.jpeg","height":150}},"metadata":{"altText":"","workURN":"","caption":"<p>The graph shows the number of IPOs by year.
