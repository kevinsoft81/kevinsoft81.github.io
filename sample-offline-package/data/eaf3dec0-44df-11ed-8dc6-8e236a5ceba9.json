Thus, Enron was effectively borrowing money, receiving cash today in exchange for a promise to pay more cash in the future. But Enron recorded the incoming cash as revenue and then hid the promises to buy the assets back in a variety of ways.","marks":[]},{"data":{"ref":"1b027a2a-9995-4898-93f7-8a87f130ae83","stage":{"ref":"44b45938-fc7a-4fb3-a2f8-88eb36b5fee1","sections":[{"ref":"8ca31643-556c-454e-8d7b-1382297531bf","rows":[{"ref":"b21378c8-4e80-46c4-b79a-793be02e49b8","columns":[{"ref":"4fc3e199-5938-4039-b3a7-cae6350a422c","stageElements":[{"ref":"9d18b671-ed9c-429d-bf17-055f94e26f05","type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"button","ref":"1bd03676-9aaa-4d9b-abaa-ecb94f4a2a23","nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"a79323f9-c8a8-412c-93fb-fb23a03b752b","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"In some cases, these promises were called “price risk management liabilities” and hidden with other trading activities; in other cases they were off-balance sheet transactions that were not fully disclosed.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}],"data":{}}]}}}]}]}]}]}},"nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"11","marks":[]}],"object":"inline","type":"footnote","ref":"07b0df9c-e3b7-47e7-83d4-0dd2929b5e19"},{"object":"text","text":" In the end, much of their revenue growth and profits in the late 1990s were the result of this type of manipulation.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"3736316a-b0a4-4a3d-bbfa-b4544e6c4491"}]}]}]}]},"screenType":"","transitions":{"enter":{"animation":"","duration":0,"easing":"","customKeyframes":""},"exit":{"animation":"","duration":0,"easing":"","customKeyframes":""}},"lockElements":false,"learnerCurrentAttempt":1,"footer":{"buttonText":"Next","buttonIcon":"Arrow","showFooter":false,"showHistoryNavButtons":false,"previewFooter":false,"position":"Fixed to screen bottom","footerComponent":{"showFooterDropArea":"hide","width":100,"footerComponentsAlignment":"right"}},"styles":{"background":{},"stage":{"maxWidth":940,"background":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","responsive":true,"padding":{"vertical":60,"horizontal":60},"border":{"color":"rgba(224, 224, 224, 1)","radius":0,"width":0}},"elements":{"padding":{"vertical":10,"horizontal":10}},"footer":{"buttonColor":"rgba(0, 115, 202, 1)","textColor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)","backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","padding":10,"corners":4,"border":"none","shadow":"0 -1px 4px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 0 12px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"},"feedback":{"width":320,"textColor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)","backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","corners":4,"border":"none","shadow":"0 5px 47px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 10px 20px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 7px 8px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"}},"title":"Enron"},"assets":[],"scenarios":[],"pluginPayload":{"pluginRepositoryPath":"https://plugin-repository-bronte-qaint.pearson.com/9417ac60-5f60-11ea-8e69-affb2224d7e8/0.15.209/ac43ee4c0eda05e9718fa83a5aed4cff.zip","summary":{"pluginId":"9417ac60-5f60-11ea-8e69-affb2224d7e8","name":"Screen","description":"A screen of a lesson","type":"screen","latestVersion":"0.15.209","subscriptionId":"f0afd4d0-d2ff-11ea-9998-d57e1e28aca1","createdAt":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 04:11:39 GMT","updatedAt":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 22:07:46 GMT","tags":[],"publishMode":"DEFAULT"}},"activityThemeIconLibraries":[]}
