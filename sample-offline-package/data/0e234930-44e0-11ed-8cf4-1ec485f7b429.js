For example, if a firm sells its goods on terms of net 30, then the factor will pay the firm the face value of its receivables, less a factor’s fee, at the end of 30 days. The firm’s customers are usually instructed to make payments directly to the lender. In many cases, the firm can borrow as much as 85% of the face value of its receivables from the factor, thereby receiving its funds in advance. In such a case, the lender will charge interest on the loan in addition to the factor’s fee. The lender charges the factor’s fee, which may range from 1% to 2% of the face value of the accounts receivable, whether or not the firm borrows any of the available funds. Both the interest rate and the factor’s fee vary, depending on such issues as the size of the borrowing firm and the dollar volume of its receivables. The dollar amounts involved in factoring agreements may be substantial. In 2017, for example, Hasbro’s competitor Mattel sold nearly $20 million of its accounts receivable under factoring arrangements.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"34e26b61-504d-41e4-8e22-3bd6bbdca81f"}]}]}]},{"cssClass":"aside-group  Sidebar_1Aside","rows":[{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"heading-two","ref":"555e66b0-c723-4dce-8521-3693350fe9af","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"A Seventeenth-Century Financing Solution","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"4b5b9b1d-5bf7-47d5-ae9b-b75dd82f400a"},{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"82fe5eb4-3383-4404-a0ba-03b882ac9a60","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"In recent years, it has become more difficult for small businesses to obtain funding so as to purchase inventory.
