He found that stock prices fluctuate much more than corporate dividends, and that the ratio of prices to dividends tends to fall when it is high, and to increase when it is low. This pattern holds not only for stocks, but also for bonds and other assets. Lars Peter Hansen developed a statistical method that is particularly well suited to testing rational theories of asset pricing.
