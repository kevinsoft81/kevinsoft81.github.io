Instead, unhappy investors typically sell their stock, so the stock of a corporation with an inept chief executive trades at a discount relative to the price at which it would trade if it had more capable leadership. In such a situation, an acquirer could purchase shares at the discounted price to take control of the corporation and replace the chief executive with a more effective one. Once the benefits of the new management team become obvious to investors, the discount for the old management will likely disappear and the acquirer can resell its shares for a profit.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"a8145b02-8e9c-43f9-b2b5-bac9754c1a65"}]}]},{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"2b3b02a7-ac25-45f0-84e2-ab5f2ef5772a","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Although identifying poorly performing corporations is relatively easy, fixing them is another matter entirely.
