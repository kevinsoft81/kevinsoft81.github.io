When General Electric (GE) agreed to buy Honeywell in October 2000, the U.S. Justice Department approved the deal with limited conditions. However, the European Commission (EC) determined that putting GE’s aircraft leasing division and Honeywell’s extensive avionics product line under the same management would lead to unacceptable anticompetitive effects in the avionics market. Despite substantial concessions by GE and top-level political lobbying by U.S. officials, the EC refused to approve the deal, and it was eventually called off. The GE/Honeywell deal was the first time a merger of two U.S. companies that had been approved by U.S. authorities was blocked by European officials. The EC had no direct jurisdiction over the merger of the companies, but it was in the position to impose crippling restrictions on sales inside the European Union.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"529f66a4-750b-4035-9cf3-05de57b28a5f"}]}]},{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"aec74d09-6571-4e9f-b6f9-50cc9288323c","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Monopoly power could be very valuable, and we would expect that in the absence of strong antitrust laws, many companies would merge. However, while all companies in an industry benefit when competition is reduced, only the merging company pays the associated costs (from, for instance, integrating the target and managing a larger corporation). Perhaps this reason, along with existing antitrust regulation, accounts for the lack of convincing evidence that monopoly gains result from the reduction of competition following takeovers. For example, financial researchers have found that the share prices of other firms in the same industry did not significantly increase following the announcement of a merger within the industry.","marks":[]},{"data":{"ref":"ac70d9c9-281f-4b52-9e53-efa6802cc8b7","stage":{"ref":"4ae1c3ea-4d94-4f13-ad51-82879069b9e9","sections":[{"ref":"f2beb7d5-d852-453a-b3c1-ae09b5ea21e0","rows":[{"ref":"60ce89e6-538e-45fe-b318-952588977011","columns":[{"ref":"ba83de1a-be72-465a-a934-e0edeaffb105","stageElements":[{"ref":"e78bcfdb-5dc5-4d19-ba48-7a0c0e13b8d2","type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"button","ref":"dbea0b47-893d-4a00-bc69-0d34ff8c5fe2","nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"95767bf5-7a34-49bf-9ea0-f293110c4a03","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"See B.
