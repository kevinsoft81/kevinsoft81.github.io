For example, the approach ignores the fact that some firms have exceptionally talented managers, others have developed more efficient manufacturing processes, and still others might hold a patent on a new technology. Discounted cash flow methods have an advantage because they allow us to incorporate specific information about the firm’s cost of capital or future growth. Thus, because the true driver of value for any firm is its ability to generate cash flows for its investors, the discounted cash flow methods have the potential to be more accurate than the use of a valuation multiple.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"9f0fb60a-cf48-48ba-847a-45b0c72d1526"}]}]}]},{"cssClass":"aside-group Sidebar_1Aside","rows":[{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"heading-two","ref":"72bb3907-62a1-42e4-a945-af5593bb1b3a","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Concept Check","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"b41034d6-9960-4d8f-90c5-278942100114"},{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"ordered-list","data":{"listOptionType":"1","startValue":3},"ref":"52b96a83-1d8c-49f0-a81f-831a1ce58766","nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"list-item","data":{"direction":"auto"},"ref":"4625d102-6dbb-4aa7-8b63-22b9f37f9663","nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"a6280538-b93d-48c9-80b9-9f894b4f6fa5","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"What are some common valuation multiples?","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]},{"object":"block","type":"list-item","data":{"direction":"auto"},"ref":"080447a2-a0b1-43b2-899b-65c875cb6caf","nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"b504cd04-0001-4e7c-845c-0dbc473778c0","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"What implicit assumptions do we make when valuing a firm using multiples based on comparable firms?","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}]}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"c3e9343d-c727-4267-8d29-c221ed0009f2"}]}]}]}]},"screenType":"","transitions":{"enter":{"animation":"","duration":0,"easing":"","customKeyframes":""},"exit":{"animation":"","duration":0,"easing":"","customKeyframes":""}},"lockElements":false,"learnerCurrentAttempt":1,"footer":{"buttonText":"Next","buttonIcon":"Arrow","showFooter":false,"showHistoryNavButtons":false,"previewFooter":false,"position":"Fixed to screen bottom","footerComponent":{"showFooterDropArea":"hide","width":100,"footerComponentsAlignment":"right"}},"styles":{"background":{},"stage":{"maxWidth":940,"background":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","responsive":true,"padding":{"vertical":60,"horizontal":60},"border":{"color":"rgba(224, 224, 224, 1)","radius":0,"width":0}},"elements":{"padding":{"vertical":10,"horizontal":10}},"footer":{"buttonColor":"rgba(0, 115, 202, 1)","textColor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)","backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","padding":10,"corners":4,"border":"none","shadow":"0 -1px 4px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 0 12px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"},"feedback":{"width":320,"textColor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)","backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","corners":4,"border":"none","shadow":"0 5px 47px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 10px 20px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 7px 8px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"}},"title":"Comparison with Discounted Cash Flow Methods"},"assets":[],"scenarios":[],"pluginPayload":{"pluginRepositoryPath":"https://plugin-repository-bronte-qaint.pearson.com/9417ac60-5f60-11ea-8e69-affb2224d7e8/0.15.209/ac43ee4c0eda05e9718fa83a5aed4cff.zip","summary":{"pluginId":"9417ac60-5f60-11ea-8e69-affb2224d7e8","name":"Screen","description":"A screen of a lesson","type":"screen","latestVersion":"0.15.209","subscriptionId":"f0afd4d0-d2ff-11ea-9998-d57e1e28aca1","createdAt":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 04:11:39 GMT","updatedAt":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 22:07:46 GMT","tags":[],"publishMode":"DEFAULT"}},"activityThemeIconLibraries":[]}
