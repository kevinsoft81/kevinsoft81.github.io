The financial manager must weigh the costs and benefits of each investment or project and decide which ones qualify as good uses of the money stockholders have invested in the firm. These investment decisions fundamentally shape what the firm does and whether it will add value for its owners. For example, it may seem hard to imagine now, but there was a time when Apple’s financial managers were evaluating whether to invest in the development of the first iPhone. They had to weigh the substantial development and production costs against uncertain future sales. Their analysis indicated that it was a good investment, and the rest is history. In this book, you will learn all the tools necessary to make these investment decisions.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"26db80b7-dce9-4fb1-bd4d-c3554faf8bdb"}]}]}]},{"cssClass":"aside-group  Sidebar_1Aside","rows":[{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"heading-two","ref":"3fea54ea-5633-413b-9cf1-7f8dba0bf55a","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Global Financial Crisis: The Dodd-Frank Act","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"37901b8a-690c-41af-88bb-c840c3057f30"},{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"5237f4ce-6e67-41e0-bdac-8d1dbe8daae8","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"In response to the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. federal government reevaluated its role in the control and management of financial institutions and private corporations.

By mid-2018, just over two-thirds of the rules had been finalized. But as the financial crisis has faded from memory and political priorities have changed, there is increasing pressure to roll back many of the Dodd-Frank reforms. For example, small- and medium-sized banks have been exempted from many of the Act’s regulations, and the Consumer Financial Protection Board, which was created by the Act, has sharply curtailed its activity under new leadership. Finally, significant changes to the “Volcker rule,” which bars banks from engaging in speculative trading, are being considered by the Federal Reserve. While these changes are intended to reduce the cost of financial services, the extent to which they increase the risk of another financial crisis remains to be seen.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"1283c0e5-c66f-45ae-8335-7fe946a2f6a4"}]}]}]}]},"screenType":"","transitions":{"enter":{"animation":"","duration":0,"easing":"","customKeyframes":""},"exit":{"animation":"","duration":0,"easing":"","customKeyframes":""}},"lockElements":false,"learnerCurrentAttempt":1,"footer":{"buttonText":"Next","buttonIcon":"Arrow","showFooter":false,"showHistoryNavButtons":false,"previewFooter":false,"position":"Fixed to screen bottom","footerComponent":{"showFooterDropArea":"hide","width":100,"footerComponentsAlignment":"right"}},"styles":{"background":{},"stage":{"maxWidth":940,"background":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","responsive":true,"padding":{"vertical":60,"horizontal":60},"border":{"color":"rgba(224, 224, 224, 1)","radius":0,"width":0}},"elements":{"padding":{"vertical":10,"horizontal":10}},"footer":{"buttonColor":"rgba(0, 115, 202, 1)","textColor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)","backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","padding":10,"corners":4,"border":"none","shadow":"0 -1px 4px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 0 12px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"},"feedback":{"width":320,"textColor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)","backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","corners":4,"border":"none","shadow":"0 5px 47px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 10px 20px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 7px 8px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"}},"title":"Making Investment Decisions"},"assets":[],"scenarios":[],"pluginPayload":{"pluginRepositoryPath":"https://plugin-repository-bronte-qaint.pearson.com/9417ac60-5f60-11ea-8e69-affb2224d7e8/0.15.209/ac43ee4c0eda05e9718fa83a5aed4cff.zip","summary":{"pluginId":"9417ac60-5f60-11ea-8e69-affb2224d7e8","name":"Screen","description":"A screen of a lesson","type":"screen","latestVersion":"0.15.209","subscriptionId":"f0afd4d0-d2ff-11ea-9998-d57e1e28aca1","createdAt":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 04:11:39 GMT","updatedAt":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 22:07:46 GMT","tags":[],"publishMode":"DEFAULT"}},"activityThemeIconLibraries":[]}
