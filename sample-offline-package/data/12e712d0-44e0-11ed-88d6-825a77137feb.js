Such an assumption often makes sense if the firm operates as a local firm in the foreign market—it purchases its inputs and sells its outputs in that market, and price changes of the inputs and outputs are uncorrelated with exchange rates. However, many firms use imported inputs in their production processes or export some of their output to foreign countries. These scenarios alter the nature of a project’s foreign exchange risk and, in turn, change the valuation of the foreign currency cash flows.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"279e2e9c-7e1e-4ec3-bda6-23ae897944ca"}]}]}]}]},"screenType":"","transitions":{"enter":{"animation":"","duration":0,"easing":"","customKeyframes":""},"exit":{"animation":"","duration":0,"easing":"","customKeyframes":""}},"lockElements":false,"learnerCurrentAttempt":1,"footer":{"buttonText":"Next","buttonIcon":"Arrow","showFooter":false,"showHistoryNavButtons":false,"previewFooter":false,"position":"Fixed to screen bottom","footerComponent":{"showFooterDropArea":"hide","width":100,"footerComponentsAlignment":"right"}},"styles":{"background":{},"stage":{"maxWidth":940,"background":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","responsive":true,"padding":{"vertical":60,"horizontal":60},"border":{"color":"rgba(224, 224, 224, 1)","radius":0,"width":0}},"elements":{"padding":{"vertical":10,"horizontal":10}},"footer":{"buttonColor":"rgba(0, 115, 202, 1)","textColor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)","backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","padding":10,"corners":4,"border":"none","shadow":"0 -1px 4px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 0 12px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"},"feedback":{"width":320,"textColor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)","backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","corners":4,"border":"none","shadow":"0 5px 47px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 10px 20px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 7px 8px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"}},"title":"23.7 Capital Budgeting with Exchange Rate Risk"},"assets":[],"scenarios":[],"pluginPayload":{"pluginRepositoryPath":"https://plugin-repository-bronte-qaint.pearson.com/9417ac60-5f60-11ea-8e69-affb2224d7e8/0.15.209/ac43ee4c0eda05e9718fa83a5aed4cff.zip","summary":{"pluginId":"9417ac60-5f60-11ea-8e69-affb2224d7e8","name":"Screen","description":"A screen of a lesson","type":"screen","latestVersion":"0.15.209","subscriptionId":"f0afd4d0-d2ff-11ea-9998-d57e1e28aca1","createdAt":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 04:11:39 GMT","updatedAt":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 22:07:46 GMT","tags":[],"publishMode":"DEFAULT"}},"activityThemeIconLibraries":[]}
