Its shortcoming is handling the realities of fast growth requiring “lumpy” investments in new capacity. The typical firm cannot smoothly add capacity in line with expected sales. Instead, it must occasionally make a large investment in new capacity that it expects to be sufficient for several years. This kind of capacity expansion also implies that new funding will happen in large, infrequent financing rounds, rather than small increments each year as sales grow. However, we can address these realities in our long-term forecasting by modeling our capacity needs and capital expenditures directly. In this section, we consider a planned expansion by KMS and generate pro forma statements that allow us to decide whether the expansion will increase the value of KMS. First, we identify capacity needs and how to finance that capacity. Next, we construct pro forma income statements and forecast future free cash flows. Finally, we use those forecasted free cash flows to assess the impact of the expansion on firm value.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"dfed9713-d553-4e0f-a576-8b2217d90562"}]}]},{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"22f47394-5917-4237-bccb-762826cfa4fe","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"KMS’s managers have constructed a detailed sales forecast by first forecasting the size of the market and what market share KMS can expect to capture.
