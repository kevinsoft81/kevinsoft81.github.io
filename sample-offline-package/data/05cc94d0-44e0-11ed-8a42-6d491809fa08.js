Yet some of them use a single cost of capital to evaluate projects throughout the organization. Using the same cost of capital for projects that have different riskiness, is, of course, a mistake, and will result in the firm taking on too many risky projects and too few safer projects. That is, when the same cost of capital is used for all investment opportunities, regardless of their riskiness, riskier projects will be discounted at too low a cost of capital, making negative NPV investments appear to be positive NPV and be accepted. Similarly, less risky projects will be discounted at too high a cost of capital, and so may be erroneously rejected.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"fb725158-09e9-44d9-a17a-57e29abd7223"},{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"7a1884d8-9f27-4488-b04e-de7c6a92ebd7","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Because survey evidence suggests that this mistake is quite common, Professors Philipp Krüger, Augustin Landier, and David Thesmar","marks":[]},{"data":{"ref":"7a0ea097-2007-447a-ac27-c371361cfb38","stage":{"ref":"70699f1f-34bd-405e-99bf-2c3e10f473a1","sections":[{"ref":"30a17dac-d9f5-40d9-8db2-2c30dec02924","rows":[{"ref":"19f708a8-9ea0-423c-80ea-17d2e30dea6a","columns":[{"ref":"15a35cb7-016f-4cc8-8458-53909d4539e2","stageElements":[{"ref":"d28227f1-f791-4ae1-9ffd-d0920a39ef3f","type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"button","ref":"b3af5ef6-713e-4582-a63a-ddd71fbc2563","nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"c9ce1680-8323-4759-b751-156cd0f91869","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"“The WACC Fallacy: The Real Effects of Using a Unique Discount Rate,” ","marks":[]},{"object":"text","text":"Journal of Finance","marks":[{"type":"italic"}]},{"object":"text","text":" 70 (2015): 1253–1285.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}],"data":{}}]}}}]}]}]}]}},"nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"*","marks":[]}],"object":"inline","type":"footnote","ref":"c4e7c1c6-1197-4700-ab0e-09ae6faab9f0"},{"object":"text","text":" looked at the behavior of conglomerates and found evidence that they were making this mistake.
