There are many reasons to trade currencies, but we will focus on those of a financial manager in a firm doing business in more than one country (a multinational firm). Consider Starbucks or Apple. Each has retail outlets in many different countries and so collects revenue in many different currencies. However, both are U.S. firms, so they will eventually want to exchange their profits in euros, yen, pounds, and other currencies into dollars. In addition to revenues, each firm has costs incurred in other countries. For example, Starbucks buys coffee all over the world and sources most of its inventory locally (milk, pastries, and so on). Similarly, Apple manufactures iPhones and MacBooks outside the United States and must pay for parts and labor in other currencies.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"2f6f9f2c-1b4a-46eb-93d5-53748d3f5191"}]}]},{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"b24f8cf2-92dd-474e-8673-b24ffe4572b5","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"The main players in the foreign exchange market are the very large, global investment banks such as Deutsche Bank, UBS, and Citibank.
