In reality, most auditors have a long-standing relationship with their audit clients; this extended relationship and the auditors’ desire to keep the lucrative auditing fees make auditors less willing to challenge management. More importantly, perhaps, most accounting firms have developed large and extremely profitable consulting divisions. Obviously, if an audit team refuses to accommodate a request by a client’s management, that client will be less likely to choose the accounting firm’s consulting division for its next consulting contract. SOX addressed this concern by putting strict limits on the amount of non-audit fees (consulting or otherwise) that an accounting firm can earn from the same firm that it audits. It also required that audit partners rotate every five years to limit the likelihood that auditing relationships become too cozy over time. Finally, SOX called on the SEC to force companies to have audit committees that are dominated by outside directors, and required that at least one outside director has a financial background.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"755dc81b-db37-4589-aec2-66f2b8075199"}]}]},{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"eaa9ec56-5c52-4895-b536-e681bf0494b6","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"SOX also stiffened the criminal penalties for providing false information to shareholders.
