In each case, proceeds from the debt will be used to repurchase stock (so the total amount of financing for the firm will not change–just the balance between debt and equity). The CFO believes that the $1 billion level will not affect the firm’s credit rating. However, each larger increase in debt will cause the debt to be downgraded one letter grade (e.g., from Baa to Ba). For example, the $10 billion scenario will lower the current debt rating one level, the $20 billion scenario would lower the rating still another level, and so on. Your job is to determine the impact of additional debt on borrowing costs at each debt level.
