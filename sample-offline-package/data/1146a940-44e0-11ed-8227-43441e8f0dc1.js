In the United States, antitrust enforcement is governed by three main statutes: the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. The Sherman Act of 1890, which was passed in response to the formation of huge oil trusts such as Standard Oil, prohibits mergers that would create a monopoly or undue market control. The Clayton Act, enacted in 1914, strengthened the government’s hand by prohibiting companies from acquiring the stock (or, as later amended, the assets) of another company if it would adversely affect competition. Under both the Sherman and Clayton acts, the government had to sue to block a merger. Often by the time a decision was rendered, the merger had taken place and it was difficult to undo it. The Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act of 1976 put the burden of proof on the merging parties. Under HSR, all mergers above a certain size (in 2019, it was $360 million, with a lower threshold of $90 million under certain conditions) must be approved by the government before the proposed takeovers occur. The government cannot delay the deal indefinitely, however, because it must respond with approval or a request for additional information within 20 days of receiving notification of the proposed merger.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"f4a48fee-1153-49f6-803b-5dc844bca439"}]}]}]},{"cssClass":"aside-group  Sidebar_1Aside","rows":[{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"heading-two","ref":"aab7e1cf-15f5-44c1-910f-d660f22842ae","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Weyerhaeuser’s Hostile Bid for Willamette Industries","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"6d59f7c8-d7ff-4038-ae9f-755102fba915"},{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"84898630-bb32-4323-a500-05f859dfd324","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"In November 2000, Weyerhaeuser, a forest products company based in Federal Way, Washington, announced a hostile bid of $48 per share for its smaller neighbor, Willamette Industries, based in Portland, Oregon.

Each time Rogel approached his old employer in private, he was rebuffed. The response to the hostile tender offer was no different.

One month before the meeting, Weyerhaeuser increased its offer to $50 per share, but Willamette’s board still believed that the offer was too low and worried that too many of its long-time employees would face layoffs after the merger.
