Assume KMS Designs is a boutique womenâ€™s fashion house, specializing in affordable fashion-forward separates, with its own production facility. KMS Designs is a growing firm and its financial managers predict that it will need external financing to fuel its growth. In order to predict when KMS will need this financing and the amount the managers will need to secure, we need to prepare a financial model in Excel for KMS that will allow us to produce pro forma income statements and balance sheets. After developing a technique for forecasting, we will turn to the steps involved in preparing the pro forma income statement and balance sheet.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"51d87df6-d22b-45aa-a180-a7e1227d7e38"}]}]}]}]},"screenType":"","transitions":{"enter":{"animation":"","duration":0,"easing":"","customKeyframes":""},"exit":{"animation":"","duration":0,"easing":"","customKeyframes":""}},"lockElements":false,"learnerCurrentAttempt":1,"footer":{"buttonText":"Next","buttonIcon":"Arrow","showFooter":false,"showHistoryNavButtons":false,"previewFooter":false,"position":"Fixed to screen bottom","footerComponent":{"showFooterDropArea":"hide","width":100,"footerComponentsAlignment":"right"}},"styles":{"background":{},"stage":{"maxWidth":940,"background":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","responsive":true,"padding":{"vertical":60,"horizontal":60},"border":{"color":"rgba(224, 224, 224, 1)","radius":0,"width":0}},"elements":{"padding":{"vertical":10,"horizontal":10}},"footer":{"buttonColor":"rgba(0, 115, 202, 1)","textColor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)","backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","padding":10,"corners":4,"border":"none","shadow":"0 -1px 4px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 0 12px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"},"feedback":{"width":320,"textColor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)","backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","corners":4,"border":"none","shadow":"0 5px 47px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 10px 20px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 7px 8px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"}},"title":"18.2 Forecasting Financial Statements: The Percent of Sales Method"},"assets":[],"scenarios":[],"pluginPayload":{"pluginRepositoryPath":"https://plugin-repository-bronte-qaint.pearson.com/9417ac60-5f60-11ea-8e69-affb2224d7e8/0.15.209/ac43ee4c0eda05e9718fa83a5aed4cff.zip","summary":{"pluginId":"9417ac60-5f60-11ea-8e69-affb2224d7e8","name":"Screen","description":"A screen of a lesson","type":"screen","latestVersion":"0.15.209","subscriptionId":"f0afd4d0-d2ff-11ea-9998-d57e1e28aca1","createdAt":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 04:11:39 GMT","updatedAt":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 22:07:46 GMT","tags":[],"publishMode":"DEFAULT"}},"activityThemeIconLibraries":[]}
