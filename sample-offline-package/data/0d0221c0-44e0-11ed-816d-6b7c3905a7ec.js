The cost of the trade credit depends on the credit terms. The higher the discount percentage offered, the greater the cost of forgoing the discount. The cost of forgoing the discount is also higher with a shorter loan period. When a company has a choice between trade credit from two different suppliers, it should take the less expensive alternative.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"57ff98bf-d834-4fc8-a88b-2d1572ea303c"}]}]},{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"58e9c59f-0443-499b-b11a-20393f183539","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"In addition, a firm should always pay on the latest day allowed.
