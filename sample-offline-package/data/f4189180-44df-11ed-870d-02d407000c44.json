In order to attract investors to invest in your firm or creditors to lend to your firm, you have to be able to offer them an expected return at least as good as what they could get elsewhere in the market for the same risk and length of investment. Now it is easier to see where the term (opportunity) cost of capital comes from—investors in your firm are giving up the opportunity to invest their funds elsewhere. This is an opportunity cost to them and to overcome it you must offer them a return equal to or better than their opportunity cost of capital. Even if you already have the funds internally in the firm to invest, the logic still applies. You could either return the funds to your shareholders to invest elsewhere, or reinvest them in a new project; however, you should only reinvest them if doing so provides a better return than the shareholders’ other opportunities.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"269ddff3-2153-4022-8ca7-e743a87a208a"},{"type":"stage-element-text","version":"0.45.1","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"8f9dea15-c18c-485b-8122-20a98fcae4ab","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"The opportunity cost of capital is the return the investor forgoes when the investor takes on a new investment.

The Opportunity Cost of Capital As we have seen in this chapter, the interest rates we observe in the market will vary based on quoting conventions, the term of the investment, and risk. In this chapter, we have developed the tools to account for these differences and gained insights into how interest rates are determined. This knowledge will provide the foundation for our study of bonds in  Chapter 6 . In  Chapter 3 , we argued that the Valuation Principle tells us to use the “market interest rate” to compute present values and evaluate an investment opportunity. But with so many interest rates to choose from, the term “market interest rate” is inherently ambiguous. Therefore, going forward in the book, we will base the discount rate that we use to evaluate cash flows on the investor’s  opportunity cost of capital  (or more simply, the  cost of capital ), which is  the best available expected return offered in the market on an investment of comparable risk and term to the cash flow being discounted. Interest Rates, Discount Rates, and the Cost of Capital By now, you may have noticed that we are using three terms to refer to rates of return. While many people use these terms interchangeably, they are distinct. Throughout this book, we will use “interest rate” to mean a quoted rate in the market. A “discount rate” is the appropriate rate for discounting a given cash flow,  matched to the frequency of the cash flow . Finally, we use “cost of capital” to indicate the rate of return on an investment of similar risk. In order to understand the definition of opportunity cost of capital, it helps to think of yourself as a financial manager competing with financial managers at other firms to attract investors’ funds (capital). In order to attract investors to invest in your firm or creditors to lend to your firm, you have to be able to offer them an expected return at least as good as what they could get elsewhere in the market for the same risk and length of investment. Now it is easier to see where the term (opportunity) cost of capital comes from—investors in your firm are giving up the opportunity to invest their funds elsewhere. This is an opportunity cost to them and to overcome it you must offer them a return equal to or better than their opportunity cost of capital. Even if you already have the funds internally in the firm to invest, the logic still applies. You could either return the funds to your shareholders to invest elsewhere, or reinvest them in a new project; however, you should only reinvest them if doing so provides a better return than the shareholders’ other opportunities. The opportunity cost of capital is the return the investor forgoes when the investor takes on a new investment. For a risk-free project, it will typically correspond to the interest rate on U.S. Treasury securities with a similar term. But the cost of capital is a much more general concept that can be applied to risky investments as well. Example 5.7 The Opportunity Cost of Capital Problem Suppose a friend offers to borrow $100 from you today and in return pay you $110 one year from today. Looking in the market for other options for investing the $100, you find your best alternative option that you view as equally risky as lending it to your friend. That option has an expected return of 8%. What should you do? Solution Plan Your decision depends on what the opportunity cost is of lending your money to your friend. If you lend her the $100, then you cannot invest it in the alternative with an 8% expected return. Thus, by making the loan, you are giving up the opportunity to invest for an 8% expected return. You can make your decision by using your 8% opportunity cost of capital to value the $110 in one year. Execute The value of the $110 in one year is its present value, discounted at 8%:  The $100 loan is worth $101.85 to you today, so you make the loan. Evaluate The Valuation Principle tells us that we can determine the value of an investment by using market prices to value the benefits net of the costs. As this example shows, market prices determine what our best alternative opportunities are, so that we can decide whether an investment is worth the cost. Chapter 3  introduced the Valuation Principle as a unifying theme in finance. In this and the preceding chapters, we have developed the fundamental tools a financial manager needs to value cash flows at different points in time. In this last section, we reiterated the importance of using market information to determine the opportunity cost of capital, which is your discount rate in valuation calculations. In  Chapter 6 , we will study bonds and how they are priced, which provides us with an immediate application of the knowledge we have built so far. Common Mistake: States Dig a $3 Trillion Hole by Discounting at the Wrong Rate Almost all states in the United States offer their employees a defined benefit pension plan guaranteeing a retirement income based on the duration of their employment with the state and their final salary. These promised payments are the plan’s liabilities—and because the payouts are guaranteed, they are comparable to a risk-free bond. To meet these liabilities, states put aside funds and invest them in risky assets like stocks and corporate bonds. Unfortunately, states make a critical, but common, mistake when determining their funding requirements: They compute the present value of the liabilities using an arbitrary discount rate (typically 8%) that is unrelated to the riskiness of the plan’s liabilities. Because of their guaranteed nature, the risk-free rate, which is currently well below 8%, is the correct discount rate for plan liabilities. 5  This error has led states to grossly underestimate the value of their liabilities—and underfunded pension plans impose a potential future obligation on taxpayers. How large is this obligation? Professors Robert Novy-Marx and Joshua Rauh 6  found that total state pension underfunding in 2008 amounted to at least $3  trillion . They also estimated that there is less than a 5% probability that, over the next 15 years, states will be able to meet their pension obligations without turning to taxpayers. Worse still, states are most likely to need the money in market downturns, precisely when taxpayers are least able to pay. Rather than correct the error, most states have continued to let the problem grow. Indeed, by 2017,  us.pensiontracker.org  estimates that the total U.S. public pension liability grew to $5.2 trillion, or more than $43,000 per household.
