These standards usually require that the company has enough shares outstanding for shareholders to have a liquid market and to be of interest to a broad set of investors. The NYSE’s standards are more stringent than those of Nasdaq; traditionally, there has been a certain pride in being listed on the NYSE. Many companies would start on the Nasdaq and then move to the NYSE as they grew. However, Nasdaq has retained many big, successful companies such as Starbucks, Apple, and Microsoft. The two exchanges compete actively over listings of larger companies (Nasdaq landed Facebook and the NYSE won Twitter’s listing) and the decision of where to list often comes down to which exchange the company’s board believes will give its stockholders the best execution and liquidity for their trades.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"3525930e-4cd3-41b4-81b4-0dd0a49a36a4"}]}]}]}]},"screenType":"","transitions":{"enter":{"animation":"","duration":0,"easing":"","customKeyframes":""},"exit":{"animation":"","duration":0,"easing":"","customKeyframes":""}},"lockElements":false,"learnerCurrentAttempt":1,"footer":{"buttonText":"Next","buttonIcon":"Arrow","showFooter":false,"showHistoryNavButtons":false,"previewFooter":false,"position":"Fixed to screen bottom","footerComponent":{"showFooterDropArea":"hide","width":100,"footerComponentsAlignment":"right"}},"styles":{"background":{},"stage":{"maxWidth":940,"background":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","responsive":true,"padding":{"vertical":60,"horizontal":60},"border":{"color":"rgba(224, 224, 224, 1)","radius":0,"width":0}},"elements":{"padding":{"vertical":10,"horizontal":10}},"footer":{"buttonColor":"rgba(0, 115, 202, 1)","textColor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)","backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","padding":10,"corners":4,"border":"none","shadow":"0 -1px 4px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 0 12px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"},"feedback":{"width":320,"textColor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)","backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","corners":4,"border":"none","shadow":"0 5px 47px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 10px 20px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 7px 8px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"}},"title":"Listing Standards"},"assets":[],"scenarios":[],"pluginPayload":{"pluginRepositoryPath":"https://plugin-repository-bronte-qaint.pearson.com/9417ac60-5f60-11ea-8e69-affb2224d7e8/0.15.209/ac43ee4c0eda05e9718fa83a5aed4cff.zip","summary":{"pluginId":"9417ac60-5f60-11ea-8e69-affb2224d7e8","name":"Screen","description":"A screen of a lesson","type":"screen","latestVersion":"0.15.209","subscriptionId":"f0afd4d0-d2ff-11ea-9998-d57e1e28aca1","createdAt":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 04:11:39 GMT","updatedAt":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 22:07:46 GMT","tags":[],"publishMode":"DEFAULT"}},"activityThemeIconLibraries":[]}
