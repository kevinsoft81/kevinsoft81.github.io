The most common problem is that people “throw good money after bad.” That is, people sometimes continue to invest in a project that has a negative NPV because they have already invested a large amount in the project and feel that by not continuing it, the prior investment will be wasted. The sunk cost fallacy is also sometimes called the “Concorde effect,” which refers to the British and French governments’ decision to continue funding the joint development of the Concorde aircraft even after it was clear that sales of the plane would fall far short of what was necessary to justify its continued development. The project was viewed by the British government as a commercial and financial disaster. However, the political implications of halting the project—and thereby publicly admitting that all past expenses on the project would result in nothing—ultimately prevented either government from abandoning the project.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"128af705-9c36-41b8-9aba-7a6bbd829247"}]}]}]},{"rows":[{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"heading-three","ref":"70b0d13f-cb00-4aa9-8a9e-e0c9f49c2582","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Past Research and Development Expenditures","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"3703036f-b5d2-4eff-9964-f2100a3714a4"},{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"b3fad7be-3e72-40e9-b2c7-86fc99483ff2","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"A pharmaceutical company may spend tens of millions of dollars developing a new drug, but if it fails to produce an effect in trials (or worse, has only negative effects), should it proceed?
