Managers face the ethical dilemma of whether to adhere to their responsibility to put the interests of shareholders first, or to do what is in their personal best interests. This problem is commonly addressed in practice by minimizing the number of decisions managers make that require putting their self-interest against the interests of the shareholders. For example, managers’ compensation contracts are designed to ensure that most decisions in the shareholders’ interest are also in the managers’ interests; shareholders often tie the compensation of top managers to the corporation’s profits or perhaps to its stock price. There is, however, a limitation to this strategy. By tying compensation too closely to performance, shareholders might be asking managers to take on more risk than they are comfortable taking. As a result, the managers may not make decisions that shareholders want them to, or it might be hard to find talented managers willing to accept the job. For example, biotech firms take big risks on drugs that fight cancer, AIDS, and other widespread diseases. The market for a successful drug is huge, but the risk of failure is high. Investors who put only some of their money in biotech may be comfortable with this risk, but managers who have all of their compensation tied to the success of such a drug might opt to develop a less risky drug that has a smaller market.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"6790718a-ed05-4c8c-8e98-244ac8203512"}]}]}]},{"cssClass":"aside-group Sidebar_1Aside","rows":[{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"heading-two","ref":"3936840b-0283-44d3-b42c-655465aa6661","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Global Financial Crisis: The Dodd-Frank Act on Corporate Compensation and Governance","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"b01e4787-f805-414c-85af-0e292a1bb310"},{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"f4d9a2a6-3c55-4150-8433-3b1580707c93","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Compensation is one of the most important conflicts of interest between corporate executives and shareholders.

Despite these high-profile examples, directors and top executives are rarely replaced through a grassroots shareholder uprising. Instead, dissatisfied investors often choose to sell their shares. Of course, somebody must be willing to buy the shares from the dissatisfied shareholders. If enough shareholders are dissatisfied, the only way to entice investors to buy (or hold) the shares is to offer them a low price. Similarly, investors who see a well-managed corporation, will want to purchase shares, which drives the stock price up.
