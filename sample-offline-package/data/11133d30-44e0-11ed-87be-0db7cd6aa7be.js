Recall that there are two broad categories of valuation approaches, which can be applied here to valuing a target company. The first—and simplest—approach compares the target to other comparable companies. Although this approach is easy to implement, it gives at best a rough estimate of value. Valuing the target using a multiple based on comparable firms does not directly incorporate the operational improvements and other synergistic efficiencies that the acquirer intends to implement. Purchasing a corporation usually constitutes a very large capital investment decision, so it requires a more accurate estimate of value including careful analysis of both operational aspects of the firm and the ultimate cash flows the deal will generate. Thus, the second approach to valuation requires making a projection of the expected cash flows that will result from the deal, and valuing those cash flows.","marks":[]}],"data":{}}]}},"config":{"cssClass":""},"ref":"ddc6f06b-5375-4a47-8d86-031a3e706011"}]}]},{"columns":[{"stageElements":[{"type":"stage-element-text","value":{"object":"value","document":{"object":"document","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","ref":"2c04c69a-e07d-48ea-88f7-d64e76231d7f","nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"A key issue for takeovers is quantifying and discounting the value added as a result of the merger.
